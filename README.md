## Develop Motivation

My first project With Flutter. I aim at getting familiar with Flutter during development. Devices I use include Android
phone, Ipad and Windows computer. E-hentai apps I used before have several bugs, and I don't understand source code because I have no development
experience with Android or ios, so I choose JHenTai to become my first Flutter Project.

2022.08.20. After five months of development, JHenTai has gradually become more and more strong, and I have completely refactored some codes for gallery page, reading page, download, etc. 
which are written at the beginning stage. I tried my best to extract the commonality between different page and style to reduce coupling, 
in order to benefit the development of new features. I would be very grateful if any kind of you could give me some advice on coding style, 
design patterns and anything related to Flutter development or participate in the development of JHenTai.

## Translation

> [languageCode](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/validity/language.xml)
>
> [countryCode](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/validity/region.xml)

1. Copy `/lib/src/l18n/en_US.dart ` and rename to `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode}.dart`
2. Rename classname in new file(optional)
3. Modify k-v pairs in method `keys` ,translate values to your language

Now you can submit your PR, I'll do the remaining things. Or you can go on with:
4. Enter `/lib/src/l18n/locale_text.dart ` , add a new k-v pair in method `keys`
   => `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {your_className}.keys()`
5. Enter `/lib/src/consts/locale_consts.dart`, add a new k-v pair in
   property `localeCode2Description`: `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {languageDescription}` to describe your language.

## Bug

1. Operations related to the clipboard may not work properly on Samsung devices due to a bug in Flutter itself.
2. Change download path to SD card is not supported now.
